    <h4>NHL career</h4>

    <p>
      (French pronunciation: ​[ʁwa]; born October 5, 1965) is a Canadian former
      professional ice hockey goaltender and the former head coach and
      vice-president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche of the
      National Hockey League (NHL). He is currently the general manager and head
      coach of the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League
      (QMJHL). He is regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders of all
      time.[3][4] In 2017 Roy was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in
      history.[5][6]

     <span> Nicknamed "Saint Patrick," </span> Roy split his playing career in the NHL between
      the Montreal Canadiens, with whom he played for 11 years, and the
      <span>Avalanche</span>, with whom he played for eight years. Roy won four Stanley Cups
      during his career, two with each franchise. Roy was born in Quebec City,
      but grew up in Cap-Rouge, Quebec.

      Roy was drafted in the third round, 51st overall, in the 1984 NHL Entry
      Draft by the Montreal Canadiens, a team he disliked, being a fan of the
      rival Quebec Nordiques.[12] His grandmother Anna Peacock was a big
      Canadiens fan, but died before seeing her grandson being drafted.[13] Roy
      kept playing for the Granby Bisons of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey
      League (QMJHL) before being called up by the Canadiens. Despite the
      thoughts that he was not going to play for the team, on February 23, 1985,
      he made his NHL debut when he replaced the Canadiens' starting goaltender,
      Doug Soetaert, in the game's third period.[12] Roy played for 20 minutes
      and earned his first NHL win without allowing a goal.<sup>[12]</sup> After the game,
      he was reassigned to the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the AHL. Despite starting
      as a backup, Roy replaced Greg Moffett after he had equipment troubles
      during a game.[12] He earned a win, became the starting goaltender for the
      playoffs and led the team to a Calder Cup championship with ten wins in 13
      games.[12]
